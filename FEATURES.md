# WarpDiff

Visual & audio comparison for creative review. Compare images, videos, or audio files. No setup, no install — runs in your browser.

## Load and compare instantly

Load 1–3 images, videos, or audio files by dragging and dropping, pressing `L`, or clicking Load. Files auto-sort by save time into Source, A, and B. A landing drop zone with hints appears when no files are loaded.

## View modes

- **Stack** (`S`) — flip between assets with arrow keys, same position and zoom
- **Grid** (`G`) — side-by-side (2 files) or all three in a row/column (3 files), auto-picks the best layout; `3` toggles inline / offset
- Mixed orientations use an equal-area layout so each asset has the same visual weight.
- Responsive grid layout auto-picks horizontal or vertical based on viewport dimensions and asset aspect ratios, re-evaluated on resize.

## Stack zoom modes

Press `\` (backslash) to toggle between **Fit** and **Match** zoom in Stack mode. A pill indicator in the header shows the current mode.

- **Fit** (default, gray pill) — each asset independently fills the viewport. Best for comparing files of different formats, aspect ratios, or crops.
- **Match** (orange pill, labeled **Match · GT**) — all assets are displayed at the same spatial scale, anchored to the **GT slot** (Ground Truth — the reference file, typically the original or unedited version). This keeps the subject the same physical size across all assets so you can judge quality, artifacts, or subtle edits directly. Requires a GT slot to be loaded; pressing `\` without one shows a reminder.

> **What is GT?** When you load files, WarpDiff sorts them by save time and assigns them to slots: **GT** (the oldest file — your reference or ground truth), **A**, and **B**. GT is the baseline you're comparing against.

Match mode is most useful when comparing assets of the **same or similar resolution** — for example, the same 1080p shot encoded two different ways. When resolutions differ significantly (e.g. a low-res reference vs. high-res outputs), Match will cause the larger assets to overflow the viewport or appear unexpectedly small, because all are locked to the GT's scale. Use Fit mode in that case.

## Zoom loupe

Press `Z` for a circular zoom loupe that follows your cursor, showing magnified native pixels without changing the overall zoom level.

- `+`/`-` adjust magnification (2×–32×)
- `[`/`]` resize the loupe (100–400px)
- `Shift+Z` enables linked zoom — hover one asset, see the same spot magnified on all others (Grid modes)

## Frame gallery

Press `Shift+G` to grab the current frame from the active slot and pin it to a gallery strip above the transport controls. Use `{` / `}` (Shift+[ / Shift+]) to step through captured frames — all videos seek to that timecode. Click any thumbnail to seek, × to remove it. Gallery clears when new media is loaded.

## Synchronized video playback

All videos play in sync with shared transport controls. Scrub, frame-step with `,`/`.`, and restart together. Per-source audio switching lets you listen to any asset's audio track independently.

With two or more videos loaded, playback is **sync-locked**: all videos loop together over the shortest clip's duration (rather than each restarting on its own clock), and a continuous drift lock holds every video on the active one's clock — within half a frame — in both Stack and Grid mode.

- `J`/`K` cycle playback speed slower/faster (0.25×, 0.5×, 0.75×, 1×, 1.25×, 1.5×, 2×)
- `I`/`O` set loop in/out points; Shift+drag on the progress bar to select a loop region. Loop points are **shared across all clips** (one region applies to every clip and stays put when you switch the active clip)
- Loop markers shown as orange triangles on the progress bar
- **Persistent mute** (`M` or the speaker icon): the master mute is sticky — if you review with audio muted, it stays muted when you load a new comparison and the next time you open WarpDiff. The muted button shows an amber **Muted** label, and the first time you press play while muted a brief reminder offers a one-click **Enable**. (Per-source GT/A/B mutes still reset per comparison.)
- **Loop range for different-length clips** (`Shift+L`, or the `Loop:` button on the transport bar): **Full** plays each clip to its full length — shorter clips hold on their last frame during the tail, and all restart together; **Sync** wraps at the shortest clip so every frame has a counterpart to compare frame-for-frame. Clips of **different lengths default to Full** (so nothing is hidden); equal-length clips use Sync. When they differ, WarpDiff flags it and highlights the Loop control

## Difference mode

Press `D` in Stack mode to overlay a pixel-difference composite of two assets. Identical pixels appear black; differences glow in proportion to the delta. Arrow keys cycle through available pairs (Source–A, Source–B, A–B with 3 files). Works with images and video — updates live during playback and on frame step. Press `D` again to turn it off.

## Video scopes

Press `V` to toggle the video scopes panel. Three scopes are displayed side by side — click the histogram or waveform to cycle through modes:

- **Histogram** — RGB → RGB + luma → CDF (cumulative distribution)
- **Waveform** — luma → RGB parade → RGB overlay
- **Vectorscope** — plots color information (Cb vs Cr) with skin tone line and color target markers

Scopes update in real time during playback and on frame step. Works on both video frames and still images.

## Audio visualization

Press `W` to toggle waveform and spectrogram views. Waveform uses dB color coding — green for normal levels, yellow for caution (>-6dB), red for hot/clipping (>-1dB). Spectrogram supports linear/log frequency scale (`Shift+W`) and multiple color palettes (`Shift+C`).

## Audio file comparison

Load 1–3 audio files (MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, etc.) to compare them side-by-side in Grid mode. Each slot shows a waveform (top) and spectrogram (bottom) with frequency labels. Info bars display sample rate, channels, bit depth (or codec name for lossy formats), file size, and EBU R128 metrics (integrated LUFS, LRA, true peak). Press `E` to cycle between waveform, waveform + LUFS envelope, and LUFS envelope only.

Spectrogram scale and palette controls (`Shift+W`, `Shift+C`) apply to all audio slots.

## Keyboard-driven workflow

Every action has a hotkey. Press `?` for help, `H` for the full hotkey list, `Esc` to dismiss. Hotkeys are fully customizable — click any key in the hotkeys panel to rebind it. Custom bindings persist across sessions.

## Installable

WarpDiff is a Progressive Web App. Install it from Chrome, Edge, or Safari for a standalone window experience. Offline-capable via service worker with network-first caching — works without an internet connection after first load.

## Works instantly

No install required, no account, no upload. Open in any browser, load your files. Everything stays local on your machine.
