# WarpDiff User Manual

WarpDiff is a browser-based visual comparison tool for reviewing 2–3 versions of images or videos side-by-side or stacked on top of each other.

## Loading Files

**Three ways to load files:**
- Press **L**
- Click the **Load** button in the header
- Drag and drop files onto the window

**File requirements:**
- 2 or 3 files (images or videos)
- 2 files → assigned to **Edit A** and **Edit B**
- 3 files → assigned to **Original**, **Edit A**, and **Edit B**
- Files are automatically sorted oldest → newest by last-modified timestamp

**Timestamp warning:** If two or more files have timestamps within 2 seconds of each other, a toast warns that the sort order may be unreliable — check that the right file landed in the right slot.

**Duplicate detection:** If two slots contain the same file (matched by name, size, and timestamp), a warning banner appears at the top of the screen.

**Reset:** Click the **Reset** button (visible after loading) to clear all files and start over.

## View Modes

### Overlay
The default mode. One asset is visible at a time, layered on top of the others. Use the arrow keys or the asset buttons in the header to switch between assets.

### Compare (2 files)
Both assets displayed side-by-side with a 16px gap between them. Assets are scaled so their shorter sides match — meaning a crop or zoom of another image will appear smaller, keeping the subject at the same physical size on screen.

The layout can be switched between **Horizontal** (left/right) and **Vertical** (top/bottom) using the buttons that appear below the media. The app auto-picks the best layout on first load based on the images' aspect ratios.

### 3-UP (3 files)
All three assets displayed in a grid: Original on the left, Edit A top-right, Edit B bottom-right. All three are scaled to the same logical size. A 16px gap separates the left and right columns.

## Switching Modes

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Click **OVERLAY** / **COMPARE** / **3-UP** in header | Switch to that mode |
| Press **O** | Toggle Overlay ↔ Compare/3-UP |
| Press **C** | Toggle Compare/3-UP ↔ Overlay |

## Zoom & Pan

Zoom and pan are available in **Overlay mode only**.

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **+** | Zoom in |
| **−** | Zoom out |
| **0** | Zoom to fit |
| **1** | Zoom to 100% (actual pixels) |
| **Click and drag** | Pan (when zoomed in) |

Zoom range: 5% – 3200%. Each step multiplies/divides by √2 (~1.41×).

In **split modes** (Compare, 3-UP), pressing **1** toggles between fit-to-panel and 100% mode (no upscaling — images smaller than their cell render at actual size).

A zoom indicator appears at the bottom-right corner of each asset showing the current scale (e.g. `1.5×`).

## Video Playback

Video controls appear at the bottom of the screen when videos are loaded. All videos play, pause, and seek in sync.

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Progress bar** | Click to seek; drag to scrub |
| **Timecode** (left) | Current position — click to toggle between time (H:MM:SS) and frame count |
| **Duration** (right of bar) | Total length |
| **Speaker icon** | Mute/unmute the active audio source |
| **Volume slider** | Adjust volume |
| **O / A / B buttons** | Select which asset's audio to hear |

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Space** | Play / Pause |
| **R** | Restart from beginning |
| **M** | Mute / Unmute |

**Audio source selector:** Only one audio track plays at a time. Click O, A, or B to switch sources. Each button has its own mute icon for independent muting. If the active source is muted, audio automatically switches to the next unmuted source.

## Info Bar

Each asset displays an info bar showing:
- Slot name (ORIGINAL, IMAGE A / EDIT A, IMAGE B / EDIT B)
- Resolution (e.g. `1920×1080`)
- Aspect ratio (e.g. `16:9`)
- Duration for videos (e.g. `0:02:34`), or `—` for images

In split modes, the info bar of the asset whose audio is currently playing is highlighted.

## Limitations

- **Images and videos only** — other file types are ignored
- **Pan available in Overlay mode only**
