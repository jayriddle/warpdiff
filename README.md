## Features

**View modes**
- **Stack** (`S`) — flip between assets with arrow keys, same position/zoom
- **Grid** (`G`) — side-by-side (2 files) or all three in a row/column (3 files), auto-picks layout; `3` toggles inline / offset
- Active asset highlighted with cyan border and info bar
- Mixed orientations use equal-area layout so each asset has the same visual weight

**Zoom loupe** (`Z`)
- Pixel-level inspection without changing your view
- `+`/`-` magnification (2×–32×), `[`/`]` resize
- `Shift+Z` linked zoom — hover one asset, see the same spot magnified on all others

**Video & audio playback**
- Synced playback across all assets
- Frame-step with `,` and `.`
- `J`/`K` slower/faster (0.25×–2×)
- Per-source audio switching (GT/A/B) with individual mute
- `I`/`O` loop in/out points, Shift+drag on timeline

**Audio file comparison**
- Load 2–3 audio files (MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.) for side-by-side waveform + spectrogram
- Info bars show sample rate, channels, bit depth/codec, file size, BPM
- Automatic BPM detection via spectral flux onset analysis

**Analysis**
- `D` difference mode — pixel difference between two assets in Stack mode; arrow keys or `Shift+D` cycle pairs (Reference–A, Reference–B, A–B)
- `V` video scopes — histogram (RGB / RGB+luma / CDF), waveform (luma / RGB parade / overlay), and vectorscope; click each scope to cycle modes
- `W` audio waveform with dB color coding + spectrogram
- `Shift+W` toggle linear/log frequency, `Shift+C` cycle spectrogram palettes

**Keyboard-first**
- Every action has a hotkey — press `?` for help, `H` for all hotkeys
- Reassign any hotkey from the hotkeys panel (click a key to rebind)
- Zoom, pan, and navigate without touching the mouse
- Preferences (loupe, volume, spectrogram settings, custom hotkeys) persist across sessions

**Installable**
- Install as a standalone app from Chrome, Edge, or Safari
- Offline-capable via service worker with network-first caching
