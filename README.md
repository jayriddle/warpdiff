## Features

**View modes**
- **Overlay** (`O`) — flip between assets with arrow keys, same position/zoom
- **Grid** (`G`) — side-by-side (2 files) or all three in a row/column (3 files), auto-picks layout
- **3-Up** (`3`) — original on the left, two edits stacked on the right — more space-efficient for larger previews

**Zoom loupe** (`Z`)
- Pixel-level inspection without changing your view
- `+`/`-` magnification (2×–32×), `[`/`]` resize
- `Shift+Z` linked zoom — hover one asset, see the same spot magnified on all others

**Video**
- Synced playback across all assets
- Frame-step with `,` and `.`
- Per-source audio switching (O/A/B) with individual mute
- `W` for waveform with dB color coding + spectrogram

**Keyboard-first**
- Every action has a hotkey — press `K` to see them all, `Esc` to dismiss
- Zoom, pan, and navigate without touching the mouse
- Preferences (loupe, volume, spectrogram settings) persist across sessions
